# sentiment-analysis
This repo shows the implementation of Sentiment Analysis using different kinds of Neural Networks.
It is in continuation of the the basic tutorial [here](https://github.com/Demfier/tensorflow_basics/)<br>
Here we will explore the different kinds of Neural Networks and see their implementation in tensorflow. At a later stage we will also see the usage of ```tflearn``` a library built on top of ```tensorflow``` that make our task a lot easier.
